### 0.6.0+5

* Updated to latest coverage package (`^0.13.0`).
* Removed deprecated `@proxy` annotations.

### 0.6.0+4

* Fixed parser to ignore lines that are not `DA` line coverage entries.
* Support for `--preview-dart-2` removed and SDK lower bound bumped to `2.0.0-dev.64.1`.

### 0.6.0+3

* Dart 2 fixes.

### 0.6.0+2

* Dart SDK constraint updated to <3.0.0.
* Package dependency updates.

### 0.6.0

* Migrated to Dart 2.0.

### 0.5.0

* Support the latest `coverage` `0.9.0` series releases.

* Support for breaking changes introduced with Dart v1.22.0.

* Added `--packages` option to all sub commands. It defaults to null, though the
  file path `.packages` will be used if no path is given in option `--package-root`.
  The `--packages` and `--package-root` options cannot be used together.
  
* Refactored `LcovCollector` so that it doesn't duplicate logic already
  present in `coverage`.
  
* Refactored `CommandLinePart`s to minimize duplicate code.

* Introduced a timeout of 60 seconds in cases where the VM doesn't respond.
  This should only be the case if the given test file contains serious syntax errors.

* [#63](https://github.com/block-forest/dart-coveralls/pulls#63)
  `--workers` is ignored and will be removed in a future release.

* [#71](https://github.com/block-forest/dart-coveralls/pulls#71)
  Submitting to coveralls now uses `source_digest` option instead of `source`.
  This greatly reduces coveralls report upload sizes.

### 0.4.0

* Add an upload-only option, which does not run any script

* Removed `LcovCollector` ctor `testFile` argument.

* `LcovCollect.getLcovInformation` added `testFile` argument.

* Added `--log-level` option to the report sub command.

### 0.3.0+1

* Support the latest `coverage` `0.7.0` series releases.

### 0.3.0

* `serviceName` was removed from `CommandLineClient`.

* `serviceName` and `serviceJobId` are now named paramaters on `CoverallsReport`
  – constructor and `parse`.

* `service_name` and `service_job_id` are correctly populated form Travis and
  Coveralls.

* Can omit the `token` flag to `report` if one of `REPO_TOKEN` or
  `COVERALLS_TOKEN` is set as an environment variable.

* The Coveralls job number and URL are printed after a successful report is
  posted to the service.

### 0.2.0

* A number of (breaking) changes to clarify and correctly distinguish between
  `projectDirectory` – the directory containing the source project – and
  `packageRoot` – the directory containing the project packages,
  usually located at `<projectDirectory>/packages`.

* A number of (breaking) changes to pass around paths – as `String` – instead of
  `File` and `Directory` instances.

* `CommandLinePart` and subtypes execute methods are now explicitly async.

* Added a lot more logging, especially in error cases.

* `covString` and related are removed from all classes. Using standard `toJson`
  method supported by `dart:convert` `JSON`.
  
* A number of public helper methods were moved to private, top-level functions.

* Added a `print-json` option to `report`.

* `LcovCollector` now puts coverage output in a temporary directory.

* `CommandLineClient` and `LcovCollector` removed dependency on `FileSystem`.
  Constructors and fields were changed accordingly.
  
* `LcovCollector` now parses *all* coverage output files.
  There is a lot less missed coverage, especially when isolates are being used.
  
* Minimum version of `coverage` was bumped to `0.6.4`.

### 0.1.12

* Support latest versions of `args` and `coverage` packages.

* Require at least Dart 1.9.0 SDK.

* Improved the reporting of errors, especially async errors.

* Add check of `CI_BRANCH` environment variable for Git branch.
